The `session` action is used to sign in the user after they successfully registered. If the option to verify the email address
before being able to sign in is enabled, the session action can be used once to bypass this requirement.

For example, after a user successfully registers for an account, you can use the session action to sign them in immediately,
bypassing the requirement to verify their email address first. This allows the user to start using the application immediately,
without having to wait for an email verification.

However, if the option to verify the email address before being able to sign in is enabled, the user will still have to verify
their email address the first time they sign in. After that, they can sign in using the session action without having to verify
their email address again.

The session action provides a convenient way to sign in users and control the flow of events in your application.

:::note

Ory automatically activates the `session` action when a user signs up using a social sign in provider.

## Toggle action

:::info

This action modifies the HTTP response. As a result, no other hooks can be executed after the `session` hook. If you want to
trigger multiple actions that modify the HTTP response in your setup, make sure that `session` is the last hook.

:::

En/disabling this feature can be done using the Ory Console or the Ory CLI:

````mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="console" label="Ory Console" default>

1. Sign in to Ory Console and select [**Authentication Settings**](https://console.ory.sh/projects/current/auth).
2. Toggle **Sign In After Registration**.
6. Click the **Save** button to save.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="Ory CLI">

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project.id} \
  --add '/selfservice/flows/registration/after/hooks/0/hook="session"'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

## Web browser registration

The hook sends a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header which contains the session cookie. The user is signed in immediately.

:::warning

Using this job as part of your post-registration workflow makes your system vulnerable to Account Enumeration Attacks because a
threat agent can distinguish between existing and non-existing accounts by checking if Set-Cookie was sent as part of the
registration response.

:::

## Native App registration

When the registration is performed through an API client (such as a mobile app), the hook creates a session and returns the
session token and the session itself in the response body as `application/json`:

```json
{
  "session": {
    "id": "..."
    // ...
  },
  "session_token": "...",
  "identity": {
    "id": "..."
    // ...
  }
}
```
