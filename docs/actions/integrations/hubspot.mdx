[Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com) is an inbound marketing, sales, and customer service platform. It provides a suite of tools and
services that allow businesses to manage and optimize their online presence, including website content, email marketing, social
media, lead generation, and analytics. Hubspot's platform is designed to be a one-stop-shop for businesses to manage their
marketing and sales efforts, and the platform integrates with a variety of third-party tools and services to provide a
comprehensive and seamless experience for users. Ory can synchronize user data with Hubspot. via the
[HubSpot contact list API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts):

To integrate Hubspot with Ory Actions, you'll need to complete the following steps:

1. Create a Hubspot account and set up the necessary contact lists for your customer data.
1. Create a [private app access token](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps) in Hubspot.
1. In your Ory Network project, set up an Ory Action trigger that will send data to the Hubspot destination whenever a specific
   event occurs, for example on successful registration.
1. Test the integration to ensure that data is being correctly routed from your Ory Actions application to Hubspot.

## Configuration

:::info

Unsure what JsonNet is? Read the [Ory Actions webhook guide](../../guides/integrate-with-ory-cloud-through-webhooks.mdx).

:::

First, we create a JsonNet file. It transforms the identity data from Ory to a format Hubspot understands:

```jsonnet title="./hubspot_identify.jsonnet"
function(ctx) {
  properties: {
    email: ctx.identity.traits.email,
    firstname: ctx.identity.traits.name,
    // ...
  },
}
```

To use this JsonNet snippet, we need to encode it to base64 and save it to the clipboard:

```shell
cat hubspot_identify.jsonnet | base64 | pbcopy
```

Next, we define the Ory Action as a JSON Object

```json title="./webhook-action.json"
{
  "hook": "web_hook",
  "config": {
    "response": {
      "ignore": true
    },
    "auth": {
      "type": "api_key",
      "config": {
        "name": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>",
        "in": "header"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts",
    "method": "POST",
    "body": "base64://ENCODED_JSONNET"
  }
}
```

and replace the values. The result will look something like this:

```json title="webhook-action.json"
{
  "hook": "web_hook",
  "config": {
    "response": {
      "ignore": true
    },
    "auth": {
      "type": "api_key",
      "config": {
        "name": "Authorization",
        "value": "Bearer hs_gzj3IFnglAJKSfs",
        "in": "header"
      }
    },
    "url": "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts",
    "method": "POST",
    "body": "base64://CmZ1bmN0aW9uKGN0eCkgewogIHByb3BlcnRpZXM6IHsKICAgIGVtYWlsOiBjdHguaWRlbnRpdHkudHJhaXRzLmVtYWlsLAogICAgZmlyc3RuYW1lOiBjdHguaWRlbnRpdHkudHJhaXRzLm5hbWUsCiAgICAvLyAuLi4KICB9LAp9"
  }
}
```

The last step is to add this action to your Ory Network Project using the Ory CLI. Here, we trigger this webhook after successful
registration:

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project.id} \
  --add "/selfservice/flows/registration/after/hooks/0=$(cat webhook-action.json)" \
  --format yaml
```

You may also trigger this webhook only when the user signs up with a password or social sign in:

```shell
ory patch identity-config {project.id} \
  --add "/selfservice/flows/registration/after/password/hooks/0=$(cat webhook-action.json)" \
  --format yaml
```
