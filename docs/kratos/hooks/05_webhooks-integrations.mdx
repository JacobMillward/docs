Ory Action webhooks should be used when you want to integrate your application with third-party services. They are used to trigger an event in your application, which then sends data to a specified URL. This allows you to automatically perform tasks or send information to other systems whenever a certain event occurs in your application, such as a new user signup, a form submission, or a successful transaction. By integrating with a CRM, CMS, or sales pipeline, you can automate tasks such as sending email campaigns, updating customer data, or creating new sales leads, making your workflow more efficient.
